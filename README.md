# AI-Chatbot
AI based chatbot, using tensorflow, nltk etc for casual conversation. With its current vocabulary you can do basic interactions, ask time, and record all conversations with time stamp.

You can easily use the chatbot by placing all these files in a single folder in the current working directory, and open the "chatbot.ipynb" file in JupyterNotebook.
NOTE: Change "intents.json" file path and in case you choose up edit/update the model, make sure to change the file path in "AI Chatbot.ipynb" as well
